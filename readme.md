# To do list

##### Made by JÃºlio Nunes

I made this project to train my jQuery skills, it was made in a day after studying jQuery from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

## How it works?

It's a simple to do list, you can write what you want to add to the list and press 'enter' or click on 'add' to add the task writen. If there's nothing writen it will give an alert message.

## What is missing?

For now I am having trouble to delete the tasks, they can be risked when accomplished, but there's still no way to delete it permanently
